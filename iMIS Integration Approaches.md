I have seen many different approaches used to integrate with iMIS over the years.  In this post I'd like to review these approaches and consider the pros and cons of each.

For this analysis we'll divide iMIS into 3 seperate areas.  The first being the component used by the organization's staff (i.e. Back Office / Staff View).  The second being the member portal (i.e. Member Website).  Lastly, we'll note the integration support offered at the time.
