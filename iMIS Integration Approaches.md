I have seen many different approaches used to integrate with iMIS over the years.  In this post I'd like to review these approaches and consider the pros and cons of each.

For this analysis we'll divide iMIS into 3 seperate areas.  The first column will be the component used by the organization's staff (i.e. Back Office / Staff View).  The second column will be the member portal (i.e. Member Website).  Lastly, in the third column we'll note the integration support offered at the time.

Let's get started!
## iMIS 10

**Back Office** | **Web** | **Integration Support**
----------------|---------|------------------------
Omnis | eSeries (Cold Fusion) | COM IBO
&nbsp; | &nbsp; | Xtender

**Approach**

1. Add custom cold fusion pages directly inside of the eSeries website.  These pages may or may not exist within their own sub-directory.
